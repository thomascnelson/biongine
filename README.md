# BioNgine (Looking for contributors)
I'm looking for help on this project, let me know if you are interested. This is the repository for BioNgine, a small, fast and simple Python module for performing various molecular biology tasks. There are other big packages out there to use, but here we want to have a minimalistic, easy and intuitive set of tools that are used very often instead of a huge and complex package.
